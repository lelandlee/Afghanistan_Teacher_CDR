# Afghanistan Teach CDR Visualization
Here we are looking at the CDR* data of an Afghan teacher in Jalalabad, the capital of Nangarhar province in Eastern Afghanistan. The goal is to determine whether the subject of interest is at the school during work hours. Each bar represents a cell tower that the subject connected to with the orange line as the total data points at that tower and the black the number during work hours. Question is, can you determine where this person lives and where he or she works?

## The Data
There are a total of 301 data points taken accross 175 days between 9/3/2016 to 2/26/2017. For this particular individual, Friday is the only non work day and the work hours are suspected to be from 08:00 to 17:00. 


****CDR*** (Call Detail Record) data is information that is recorded by telecommunication companies whenever a phone needs (calls, texts, data, etc) to connect to a cell tower. Generally a phone will connect to the nearest cellular tower, however that is not always the case due to load balancing.
